</div>

This is a **Nuxt 3-based CMS Template** that is fully integrated with [Directus](https://directus.io/), offering a CMS
solution for managing and delivering content seamlessly. The template leverages modern technologies like **Nuxt 3's
file-based routing system**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Shadcn Vue components**, providing a complete and scalable starting
point for building CMS-powered web applications.

## **Features**

- **Nuxt 3 File-Based Routing**: Uses Nuxt's built-in routing system with dynamic page handling.
- **Full Directus Integration**: Directus API integration for fetching and managing relational data.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Fully integrated for rapid UI styling.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and reliable code quality.
- **Shadcn Vue Components**: Pre-built, customizable UI components for modern design systems.
- **ESLint & Prettier**: Enforces consistent code quality and formatting.
- **Dynamic Page Builder**: A page builder interface for creating and customizing CMS-driven pages.
- **Preview Mode**: Built-in draft/live preview for editing unpublished content.
- **Optimized Dependency Management**: Project is set up with **pnpm** for faster and more efficient package management.

## **Why pnpm?**

This project uses `pnpm` for managing dependencies due to its speed and efficiency. If you’re familiar with `npm`,
you’ll find `pnpm` very similar in usage. You can still use `npm` if you prefer by replacing `pnpm` commands with their
`npm` equivalents.

## **Draft Mode in Directus and Live Preview**

### **Draft Mode Overview**

Directus allows you to work on unpublished content using **Draft Mode**. This Nuxt 3 template is configured to support
Directus Draft Mode out of the box, enabling live previews of unpublished or draft content as you make changes.

### **Live Preview Setup**

[Directus Live Preview](https://docs.directus.io/guides/headless-cms/live-preview/nuxt-3.html#set-up-live-preview-with-nuxt-3)

- The live preview feature works seamlessly on deployed environments.
- To preview content on **localhost**, deploy your application to a staging environment.
- **Important Note**: Directus employs Content Security Policies (CSPs) that block live previews on `localhost` for
  security reasons. For a smooth preview experience, deploy the application to a cloud environment and use the
  deployment URL for Directus previews.

### **Admin Bar**

Allows authenticated users to easily navigate to their **Directus instance** to edit or create pages and posts directly
from the frontend.

#### How It Works

By appending `?preview=true` to the URL, users enter **Admin Mode**, which:

- Displays an admin bar at the top of the page.
- Allows easy navigation to **edit** or **create** new posts/pages in Directus.
- Requires authentication to access edit and new content buttons.

#### Usage

To enable the **Admin Bar**, simply append `?preview=true` to any URL:

```plaintext
https://yourwebsite.com/blog/some-post?preview=true
```
